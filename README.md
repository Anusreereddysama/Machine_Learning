# Support Vector Machine (SVM) – Streamlit Web Application

This project demonstrates the implementation and deployment of a **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** model using **Python** and **Streamlit**.  
It was developed as part of **Week 11** of my **300-hour Data Science & AI program** at **CVR College of Engineering, Hyderabad**, in collaboration with **TechWorks**, under the guidance of **Suhel Shaik sir**.

## 📌 Project Overview

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm used for **classification and regression** tasks.  
In this project, I focused on:
- Understanding how SVM constructs optimal **decision boundaries**
- Exploring different **kernel functions**
- Making the model accessible through an **interactive web application**
